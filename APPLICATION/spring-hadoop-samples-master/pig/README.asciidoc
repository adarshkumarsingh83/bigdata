== Pig samples

There are three sample applications that use Pig, each sample getting more sophisticated in its use of Pig.  The examples are

* A simple /etc/passwd file analysis application using PigRunner
* Using PigTemplate to execute Pig scripts
* A more complex Apache Log file analysis example using PigRunner

=== Building and running

Use the following commands to build and run the sample

    $ mvn clean package
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/pigApp
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/pigAppWithRepository
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/pigAppWithApacheLogs
